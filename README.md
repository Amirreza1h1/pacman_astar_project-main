# Pacman Astar Project

This project find the shortest path between pacman position and nearest food and do it for count of foods in selected grid.

## Usage

Just run pacman.py with

```
python pacman.py
```

## Run

![game_play](pacman.gif)

<p>it uses turtle library for showing the game play.</p>

## Logic

<p>Before pacman moves it realises the Manhattan distance of each food and choose it as the first in a list, then from that point; find the nearest one and append it to the list and do it in a loop and after that it starts to move.</p>
